         	<h1>Education</h1>

			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> I'm a Graphic Artist passionate about all things creative and new! Proficient in Adobe Creative Suite and in the process of learning HTML code. Experienced in creating web and print designs, sample layouts, and generating new concepts with limited direction. Enthusiastic about / accustomed to working in fast-paced environments. </p>

			<h1>Graphic Design</h1>
			<p>I am proficient in adobe creative suite, procreate, and have "light" coding skills. This website has worked both as a space for me to showcase my portfolio, and as an exercise in creating a digital platform from scratch. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
			<h1>Editorial Design</h1>
			<p>The Editorial world is what first got me into graphic design. First, it was my childhood obsession with publishing a book, then it was my love for fashion magazines. I loved the exciting layouts and how the typography intermixed with the graphics. I was first introduced to this work during an internship my senior year of high school at Santa Barabra Magazine. This was a pivotal time in my career, and after working at places such as Document Journal and Musee Magazine, my love for editorial design has truly been solidified.</p>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
			<h1>Web Design</h1>
			<p>Web design is a passion of mine, as hopefully exemplified on this site. I enjoy creating sleek designs, with a bit of uniqueness, and am comfortable doing so. However, I am hoping to find creative jobs in the future where I can create maximalist designs.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-6 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.4s">
			<h1>Copywriting</h1>
			<p>While my main interests, and career pursuits, are geared toward the design realm, writing is something I will continue to do for as long as I can. I enjoy the idea of merging the two industries and finding a space where I can both create copy and curate it in a digital space.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-6 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.6s">
			<h1>Print-Making</h1>
			<p> Print making, and silk-screen in particular, has always been a favorite hobby of mine. Hands-on work has been very satisfying to me and something I would love to integrate into a workspace.</p>
